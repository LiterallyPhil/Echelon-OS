# üöÄ Life OS - Deployment Guide

Complete step-by-step guide for deploying Life OS to Atlassian Cloud.

## Prerequisites

- Atlassian Cloud account with admin access
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Forge CLI installed globally
- Git repository access

## Step 1: Initial Setup

### Install Forge CLI

```bash
npm install -g @forge/cli
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
forge --version
```

## Step 2: Configure Forge

### Login to Atlassian

```bash
forge login
```

This will open your browser and prompt you to authorize the CLI.

### Register Your App

```bash
cd forge-app
forge register
```

Follow the prompts:
- Create a new app
- Name: "Life OS for Business Teams"
- Select scopes (already configured in manifest.yml)

## Step 3: Development Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start Development Tunnel

```bash
forge tunnel
```

This creates a local tunnel for development. The app will be accessible at your Atlassian site with live-reload.

## Step 4: Build & Test

### Lint Your Code

```bash
forge lint
```

### Build the App

```bash
forge build
```

Fix any build errors before proceeding.

## Step 5: Install in Development

### Deploy to Development Environment

```bash
forge deploy
```

This uploads your app to Forge's development environment.

### Install in Your Site

```bash
forge install
```

Select your site when prompted. The app will be installed in development mode.

### Access the App

1. Go to your Jira or Confluence site
2. Navigate to Apps ‚Üí Manage apps
3. Find "Life OS for Business Teams"
4. Click to open the dashboard

## Step 6: Production Configuration

### Update Production App ID

Edit `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
app:
  id: ari:cloud:ecosystem::app/YOUR-PRODUCTION-APP-ID
```

### Set Environment Variables

Create `.env.production`:

```env
FORGE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.atlassian.com
FORGE_APP_ID=your-production-app-id
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Step 7: Deploy to Production

### Build Production Version

```bash
forge build --prod
```

### Deploy to Production

```bash
forge deploy --prod
```

This uploads to production. Your app is now available to all users.

## Step 8: Marketplace Submission (Optional)

### Prepare Marketplace Listing

1. Create screenshots:
   - Dashboard overview
   - Rovo chat interface
   - Confluence reports

2. Write listing description (see MARKETPLACE.md)

3. Prepare demo video (‚â§5 min)

### Submit for Review

1. Go to Atlassian Developer Console
2. Click "Submit for certification"
3. Upload all required materials
4. Wait for approval (typically 2-4 weeks)

## Step 9: Post-Deployment

### Configure Webhooks (for real-time updates)

Edit your Forge triggers in `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
function:
  - key: issue-updated-trigger
    handler: src/triggers/issueUpdated
```

### Set Up Scheduled Reports

Configure weekly Confluence report generation in your backend:

```typescript
// Add to index.ts
resolver.define('scheduleWeeklyReport', async () => {
  await scheduleWeeklyReport();
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" Errors

Solution:
1. Check manifest.yml scopes
2. Verify app has required permissions
3. Uninstall and reinstall app

### Build Errors

Solution:
1. Check TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. Verify all imports are correct
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed

### App Not Loading

Solution:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify tunnel is running: `forge tunnel`
3. Check app logs: `forge logs`

### Storage API Issues

Solution:
1. Verify storage scope in manifest
2. Check storage quota limits
3. Clear old data if needed

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Development

```bash
# Use tunnel for local development
forge tunnel

# Access at: https://your-domain.atlassian.net
```

### Staging

```bash
# Deploy to staging
forge deploy --env staging
```

### Production

```bash
# Deploy to production
forge deploy --prod

# Monitor logs
forge logs --env production
```

## Monitoring

### View Logs

```bash
# Development logs
forge logs

# Production logs
forge logs --env production

# Filter by function
forge logs --function life-os-resources
```

### Check App Health

```bash
# App status
forge status

# API usage
forge usage
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback to Previous Version

```bash
# List versions
forge versions

# Restore version
forge restore VERSION_ID
```

### Uninstall App

```bash
# Uninstall from your site
forge uninstall

# Remove from marketplace
# Do this via Atlassian Developer Console
```
