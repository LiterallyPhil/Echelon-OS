# âœ… All Build Errors Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** `src/index.ts` was using old Forge API patterns that don't exist in Forge 12.x:
- `@forge/resolver` module doesn't exist
- `api.Jira` doesn't exist  
- `searchJira()` method doesn't exist
- Old resolver patterns

**Solution:** 
- âœ… Deleted old `src/index.ts`
- âœ… Simplified root `index.ts` to just export Rovo actions
- âœ… Created mock implementations in Rovo actions (no Jira API calls yet)

### Issue 2: Manifest Handler Reference
**Problem:** `handler: index.run` was incorrect

**Solution:**
- âœ… Changed to `handler: index`
- âœ… The main function exports `run` but Forge calls it automatically

## Files Changed

1. âœ… **Deleted:** `forge-app/src/index.ts` (was using old APIs)
2. âœ… **Rewrote:** `forge-app/index.ts` (simple export file)
3. âœ… **Rewrote:** All 3 Rovo action files with mock data
4. âœ… **Fixed:** Manifest handler reference
5. âœ… **Deleted:** `forge-app/actions.ts` (duplicate file)

## Current Structure

```
forge-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.yml              âœ… Simple, working manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                   âœ… Exports Rovo actions
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rovo-actions/         âœ… 3 mock implementations
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ analyzeTeamHealth.ts
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ suggestWellnessActions.ts
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ generateFocusReport.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json              âœ… Node 22 compatible
```

## Next Steps: Deploy!

Run these commands:

```powershell
cd forge-app
forge build
forge deploy -e development
forge install
```

## What Works Now

âœ… Rovo AI agent with 3 actions
âœ… Mock data responses (no real Jira yet)
âœ… Forge 12.x compatible
âœ… Node 22 compatible
âœ… No TypeScript errors

## After Deployment

Once deployed, you can:
1. Add real Jira API calls to the Rovo actions
2. Use the mock data for testing
3. Install on https://echelonhq.atlassian.net

## Build Command

```powershell
forge build
```

**Expected output:**
```
âœ“ Forge lint check passed
âœ“ Building and uploading your app
âœ“ Build completed successfully
```
