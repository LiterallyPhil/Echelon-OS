## Metrics Calculation Explained

### Focus Score Formula
```typescript
baseScore = 100 - (activeTasks * 5)
penalty = highPriorityTasks * 10
bonus = min(20, completedTasks * 2)
focusScore = clamp(0, 100, baseScore - penalty + bonus)
```

**Interpretation:**
- 70-100: Excellent focus, maintain pace
- 40-69: Good focus, room for improvement  
- 0-39: Low focus, intervention needed

### Burnout Risk Assessment
```typescript
riskScore = 0
if issuesLast30Days > 40: riskScore += 40
if commentsCount > 60: riskScore += 40

riskLevel = 
  if riskScore < 30: 'low'
  else if riskScore < 60: 'medium'
  else: 'high'
```
